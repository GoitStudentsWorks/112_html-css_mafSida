# Green Harvest Project

A responsive website promoting a healthy lifestyle, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite.

## Overview
This project is part of the GoIT Full Stack Developer course, created by our team as a collaborative assignment. It focuses on creating a responsive, accessible website with modern UI/UX, optimized images, and mobile-first design. The project includes the implementation of screen reader accessibility, lazy loading for images, and the use of Vite as a build tool.

The design mockup used for this project can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/ObvvH4JjCuw8gBzYmiLIII).

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://your-github-pages-link](https://mafsida.github.io/green-harvest-team-project/).

Our team is named **beHealthy**, and we would like to thank our project mentor, **Daria Lyman**, for her prompt code reviews and clear instructions for adjustments.
